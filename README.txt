Assignment 4: Prolog

What's Included: assignment4.pl and this README

To Run: Install prolog on your linux machine: http://www.swi-prolog.org/
        Run any of the functions in the file in prolog with their input being clauses or dysjunctions of clauses. Some prior knowledge of the 		3-SAT simple-hill-climb technique are needed to understand why these smaller functions are needed. 

Assignment: 

We were to re-implement the first 6 steps of the hill climb np-complete problem that we did in Scheme. As far as explaining "progress," I tested all of my functions using the test input on the assignment prompt as well as some of my own. The only abnormality is that with #6, if you try to flip the first variable, it will print it out and not allow the user to press ';' to see the 'false.' However it works like this when looking for every other variable in a state list and it works like this for the other 5 problems.
